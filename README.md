# SiteWatcher
## Purpose
SiteWatcher is a Chrome Extension with the goal of helping users to keep up to date with numerous websites, without having to constantly check them manually for updates.
Many people read blogs, web comics, or keep tabs on news websites. These can update infrequently, sometimes going days, weeks, months, or even years between updates. Checking constantly if a website has updated can be disheartening and boring. SiteWatcher does this automatically so you don't have to.
